Food traceability requirements that go into effect early next year are forcing grocers to confront financial hurdles and supplier challenges — and 
also legal consequences if they are non-compliant. Retailers now have less than one year to meet the requirements of section 204 of the Food Safety 
Modernization Act (FSMA), which goes into effect on Jan. 20, 2026. The legislation aims to improve supply chain traceability to more quickly 
identify and remove potentially contaminated foods. It’s important that retailers to understand the requirements, given that they are also liable 
under the rule, Derek Hannum, chief customer officer at ReposiTrak, shared during a webinar hosted by the National Grocers Association in November. 

Food traceability is not always a simple burden though, as some large retailers such as Walmart boast food traceability programs that exceeed those
required by the FDA. This makes Walmart a more attractive retailer for food as if there was ever contamination with food, the likelyhood of it 
affecting the customer end of low.
