Quantum computing is a contemporary technology often touted for its high speed and
power for computing numbers. The developments have been set to improve humanity as
a whole, by potentially processing difficult numbers to solve a plethora of 
problems, to make computing faster, or even simply providing a gate way for 
commercial consumer quantum computing. A home quantum computer, how cool is that!

However, is a much more sinister side to quantum computing, but not for the reason 
you might think. The modern internet relies on algorithms such as RSA and ECC for
encryption, which themsevles depend on the difficulties of factoring large prime
numbers. For any standard computer set up, no matter how powerful, it is a large
challenge. Quantum computers' ability to crunch numbers effectivly poses an
enormous threat to this system. If a hacker or even a quantum computer reasearcher
with malicous intents uses a quantum computer to bypass the difficulties of negating
RSA and ECC algorithms, the privacy and security of the internet could be put at
risk.

The internet is not the only system threatened by the serious computing power of
said computers, as the encryption method of many defense deparments for countries
also depend of the challange of factoring prime numbers. This said, quantum
computing poses a threat to the national security of many countries, prompting
the encouragement of the development of new future proof encryption methods.

This serious and current threat is large concern and is a caveat to the development
of quantum computing.
