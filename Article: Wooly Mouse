TITLE: Scienctists create a "woolly mouse" with woolly mammoth dna and could this be a big step to restoring the woolly mammoth
On the day of March 4th 2025. A new species of Mouse is artificially made by combinding mammoth dna into a mouse that has curly whiskers and wavy, light hair that grows three times longer than that of an ordinary lab mouse
We believe that this is a crucial path to restoring ther woolly mammoth. While the woolly mouse can act like a regular mouse but with long and thick hair
Could it survive in cold weather like the times from the woolly mammoth times. i think scienctists think so but i dont belive so since the woolly mammoth's had way thicker fur and body heat to keep itself warm while the mouse has the same thick fur but not the body to survive in -22°F to -58°F weather
But Colossal the company that was behind all of this said that the wooly mouse would enable the link between specific DNA sequences and physical traits that lets it adapt to liveable conditions in cold climates
This is what one of the scientist Dr. Beth Shapiro who helped create the woolly mouse said “It is an important step toward validating our approach to resurrecting traits that have been lost to extinction and that our goal is to restore,” 
Here is the story on how to create a woolly mouse
"To create the woolly mouse, The company behind this Colossal said it had identified genetic variants of mammoths and the woolly mammoths closest living creature is the Asian elephant.
Colossal scientists had 10 elephants related to thickness, texture, color and body fat
The scientists looked for a gene known as FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor 5) which triggers the cycle of hair growth, creating longer thicker hair. They also altered the function of three genes related to hair follicle development and structure to create woolly hair texture, wavy coats and curled whiskers," As the science team of Colossal said publicly
It is very surprising that we are close to reviving a extinct animal by using DNA from today from diffrent animals since most people thought it was impossible a long time ago to revive any animals.
And here is what a scientist said about the mice
