Tunnel diodes are electrical components often used in RF (radio frequency) applications where designs
requiring negative resistance is needed. The most common application for these diodes are in oscillators,
detectors, and amplifiers, and switching circuits where the negatove resistance property of tunnel diodes
are useful.

Tunnel diodes operate on the principle of Quantum Mechanical Tunneling, where electrons pass through a 
potential energy barrier. This gives the diode the unique property of negative resistance, where the 
more voltage you apply, the less current flows. It would seem it follows a negative ohms law, where
I = R/V.

What makes tunnel diodes special is their extremely low junction capacitance, making them useful in 
applications where high frequencies are used.
