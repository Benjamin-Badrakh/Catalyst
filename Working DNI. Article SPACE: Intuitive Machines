TITLE: Intuitive Machines: Athena lander is on the moon’s surface but its current status is unknown
A robotic lander named Athena has made its final descent to the moon’s surface, marking the second lunar landing for a US company this week. But the orientation of Athena is currently unknown.
Houston based Intuitive Machines, which last year became the first private sector company to soft land a vehicle on the moon, said that its Athena spacecraft was expected to touch down around 11:31 a.m. CT (12:31 p.m. ET) on March 6th 2025.
The company confirmed Athena was on the moon and that mission control was communicating with the lander during a live broadcast of the event, cohosted by NASA and Intuitive Machines. Shortly after landing, the team powered down systems that were not required, said Josh Marshall, the company’s communications director.
Taylor was confident the expedition in which she is participating would add more new species to the list including what she suspected was a previously unknown coral collected three days earlier. “This is an area of the world that’s very remote,” she said. “It took eight days on the boat from southern Chile to get here. It’s very rarely visited.”
