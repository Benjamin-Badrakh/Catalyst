TITLE: Ambitious effort to document marine life shows 866 new species and still going
On the Day of March 13th 2025 A guitar shaped shark, a fan like coral and a venomous deep sea snail equipped with harpoon like teeth are among 866 previously unknown species discovered as part of an ambitious effort to document marine life that has not been documented by scientists.
Found by divers, piloted submersibles and remotely operated vehicles during 10 ocean expeditions, the species have all been deemed new to science, according to Ocean Census, a global alliance to protect sea life, which this week released the first major update since its launch in 2023.
The 10 year project aims to plug the huge gaps that exist in scientists’ knowledge of the ocean depths. Michelle Taylor, a coral expert at the University of Essex and a principal investigator at Ocean Census, said the scope for discovery is immense.
“Probably only 10% of marine species have been discovered,” Taylor told CNN from onboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s Falkor research vessel while on a 35 day expedition to the South Sandwich Islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean.
“And for the species that have been discovered with Ocean Census, it’s across such a wide variety so everything from sharks to pipefish to gastropods are being discovered
Scientists found a new species of coral at depths of 3 feet (1 meter) to 3.1 miles (4,990 meters), with analysis conducted by scientists involved in the Ocean Census Science Network, which includes more than 800 scientists from 400 institutions.
