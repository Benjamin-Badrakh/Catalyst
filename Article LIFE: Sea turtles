TITLE: Sea Turtles are laying eggs earlier in response to climate change
On March 7th 2025 Sea turtles are responding to climate change by nesting earlier in the year in a move to compensate for rising temperatures, researchers monitoring the breeding habits of green and loggerhead turtles in Cyprus have discovered.
Observing the ‘natal philopatry’ common in sea turtles a kind of homint system which sees them return to nest in the area where they themselves hatched a research team from the University of Exeter witnessed a changing behaviour in nesting over the last three years.
The temperature plays a crucial role in the sea turtles nesting and hatching process. In these species, temperature determines the biological sex of offspring, with more females born when it’s warmer and affecting the hatching success rate when it gets too hot.
And for each 1 celcius increase in sea temperature sea turtles lay eggs 6 days earlier.
To understand how turtles are adapting, conservation ecologist Annette Broderick and colleagues analyzed three decades of nesting data from around 600 tagged sea turtles on the beaches of Northern Cyprus. The data included the number of successful hatchlings in each nest and temperatures during incubation. The team found that individual females nested earlier as temperatures rose, laying eggs just over six days earlier.
