TITLE: Intuitive Machines: Athena lander is on the moon’s surface but its current status is unknown
On the Day of March 6th 2025 A robotic lander named Athena has made its final descent to the moon’s surface, marking the second lunar landing for a US company this week. But the orientation of Athena is currently unknown.
Houston based Intuitive Machines, which last year became the first private sector company to soft land a vehicle on the moon, said that its Athena spacecraft was expected to touch down around 11:31 a.m. CT (12:31 p.m. ET) on March 6th 2025.
The company confirmed Athena was on the moon and that mission control was communicating with the lander during a live broadcast of the event, cohosted by NASA and Intuitive Machines. Shortly after landing, the team powered down systems that were not required, said Josh Marshall, the company’s communications director.
