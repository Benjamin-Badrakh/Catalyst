TITLE: Sea Turtles are laying eggs earlier in response to climate change
Sea turtles are responding to climate change by nesting earlier in the year in a move to compensate for rising temperatures, researchers monitoring the breeding habits of green and loggerhead turtles in Cyprus have discovered.
Observing the ‘natal philopatry’ common in sea turtles a kind of homint system which sees them return to nest in the area where they themselves hatched a research team from the University of Exeter witnessed a changing behaviour in nesting over the last three years.
The temperature plays a crucial role in the sea turtles nesting and hatching process. In these species, temperature determines the biological sex of offspring, with more females born when it’s warmer and affecting the hatching success rate when it gets too hot.
